The new intentless policy leverages large language models (LLMs) to complement
existing rasa components and make it easier:

- to build assistants without needing to define a lot of intent examples
- to handle conversations where messages
  [don't fit into intents](https://rasa.com/blog/were-a-step-closer-to-getting-rid-of-intents/)
  and conversation context is necessary to choose a course of action.

Using the `IntentlessPolicy`, a 
question-answering bot can already understanding many different ways 
that users could phrase their questions - even across a series of user messages:

/>

This only requires appropriate responses to be defined in the domain file.

To eliminate hallucinations, the policy only chooses which response from 
your domain file to send. It does not generate new text. 

In addition, you can control the LLM by:
- providing example conversations (end-to-end stories) which will be used in the prompt.
- setting the confidence threshold to determine when the intentless policy should kick in.

[This repository](https://github.com/RasaHQ/starter-pack-intentless-policy) contains a starter pack with a bot that uses the
`IntentlessPolicy`. It's a good starting point for trying out the policy and for
extending it.

## Demo

[Webinar demo](https://hubs.ly/Q01CLhyG0) showing that this policy can already
handle some advanced linguistic phenomena out of the box.

The examples in the webinar recording are also part of the end-to-end tests
defined in the [example repository](https://github.com/RasaHQ/starter-pack-intentless-policy) in (`tests/e2e_test_stories.yml`).

## Adding the Intentless Policy to your bot

The `IntentlessPolicy` is part of the `rasa_plus` package. To add it to your
bot, add it to your `config.yml`:

```yaml-rasa title="config.yml"
policies:
  # ... any other policies you have
  - name: rasa_plus.ml.IntentlessPolicy
```

## Customization

### Combining with NLU predictions
The intentless policy can be combined with NLU components which predict 
intents. This is useful if you want to use the intentless policy for
some parts of your bot, but still want to use the traditional NLU components for
other intents. 

The `nlu_abstention_threshold` can be set to a value between 0 and 1. If 
the NLU prediction confidence is below this threshold, the intentless policy 
will be used if it's confidence is higher than the NLU prediction. Above the 
threshold, the NLU prediction will always be used.

The following example shows the default configuration in the `config.yml`:

```yaml-rasa title="config.yml"
policies:
  # ... any other policies you have
  - name: rasa_plus.ml.IntentlessPolicy
    nlu_abstention_threshold: 0.9
```

If unset, `nlu_abstention_threshold` defaults to `0.9`.

### LLM / Embeddings configuration

You can customize the openai models used for generation and embedding.

#### Embedding Model
By default, OpenAI will be used for embeddings. You can configure the
`embeddings.model_name` property in the `config.yml` file to change the used
embedding model:

```yaml-rasa title="config.yml"
policies:
  # ... any other policies you have
  - name: rasa_plus.ml.IntentlessPolicy
    embeddings: 
      model_name: text-embedding-ada-002
```

Defaults to `text-embedding-ada-002`. The model name needs to be set to an
[available embedidng model.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/embedding-models).

#### LLM Model

By default, OpenAI is used for LLM generation. You can configure the
`llm.model_name` property in the `config.yml` file to specify which
OpenAI model to use:

```yaml-rasa title="config.yml"
policies:
  # ... any other policies you have
  - name: rasa_plus.ml.IntentlessPolicy
    llm: 
      model_name: text-davinci-003
```
Defaults to `text-davinci-003`. The model name needs to be set to an
[available GPT-3 LLM model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3).

If you want to use Azure OpenAI Service, you can configure the necessary
parameters as described in the
[Azure OpenAI Service](./llm-setup.mdx#additional-configuration-for-azure-openai-service)
section.

#### Other LLMs / Embeddings

By default, OpenAI is used as the underlying LLM and embedding provider. 

The used LLM provider and embeddings provider can be configured in the
`config.yml` file to use another provider, e.g. `cohere`: 

```yaml-rasa title="config.yml"
policies:
  # ... any other policies you have
  - name: rasa_plus.ml.IntentlessPolicy
    llm: 
      type: "cohere"
    embeddings:
      type: "cohere"
```

For more information, see the
[LLM setup page on llms and embeddings](./llm-setup.mdx#other-llms--embeddings).

### Other Policies

For any rule-based policies in your pipeline, set
`use_nlu_confidence_as_score: True`. Otherwise, the rule-based policies will
always make predictions with confidence value 1.0, ignoring any uncertainty from
the NLU prediction:

```yaml-rasa title="config.yml"
policies:
  - name: MemoizationPolicy
    max_history: 5
    use_nlu_confidence_as_score: True
  - name: RulePolicy
    use_nlu_confidence_as_score: True
  - name: rasa_plus.ml.IntentlessPolicy
```

This is important because the intentless policy kicks in only if the other
policies are uncertain:

- If there is a high-confidence NLU prediction and a matching story/rule, the
  `RulePolicy` or `MemoizationPolicy` will be used.

- If there is a high-confidence NLU prediction but no matching story/ rule, the
  `IntentlessPolicy` will kick in.

- If the NLU prediction has low confidence, the `IntentlessPolicy` will kick in.

- If the `IntentlessPolicy` prediction has low confidence, the `RulePolicy` will
  trigger fallback based on the `core_fallback_threshold`.

**What about TED?**

There is no reason why you can't also have TED in your configuration. However,

- TED frequently makes predictions with very high confidence values (~0.99) so
  will often override what the `IntentlessPolicy` is doing.
- TED and the `IntentlessPolicy` are trying to solve similar problems, so your
  system is easier to reason about if you just use one or the other.

## Steering the Intentless Policy

The first step to steering the intentless policy is adding and editing responses
in the domain file. Any response in the domain file can be chosen as an response
by the intentless policy. This whitelisting ensures that your assistant can
never utter any inappropriate responses.

```yaml-rasa title="domain.yml"
utter_faq_4:
  - text:
      We currently offer 24 currencies, including USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CAD, AUD,
      and more!
utter_faq_5:
  - text:
      Absolutely! We offer a feature that allows you to set up automatic
      transfers to your account while you're away. Would you like to learn more
      about this feature?
utter_faq_6:
  - text:
      You can contact our customer service team to have your PIN unblocked. You
      can reach them by calling our toll-free number at 1-800-555-1234.
```

Beyond having the `utter_` prefix, the naming of the utterances is not relevant.

The second step is to add
[end-to-end stories](../training-data-format.mdx#end-to-end-training)
to `data/e2e_stories.yml`. These stories teach the LLM about your domain, so it
can figure out when to say what.

```yaml title="data/e2e_stories.yml"
- story: currencies
  steps:
    - user: How many different currencies can I hold money in?
    - action: utter_faq_4

- story: automatic transfers travel
  steps:
    - user: Can I add money automatically to my account while traveling?
    - action: utter_faq_5

- story: user gives a reason why they can't visit the branch
  steps:
    - user: I'd like to add my wife to my credit card
    - action: utter_faq_10
    - user: I've got a broken leg
    - action: utter_faq_11
```

The stories and utterances in combination are used to steer the LLM. The
difference here to the existing policies is, that you don't need to add a lot of
intent examples to get this system going.

## Testing

The policy is a usual Rasa Policy and can be tested in the same way as any other
policy.

### Testing interactively
Once trained, you can test your assistant interactively by running the following
command:

```bash
rasa shell
```

If a flow you'd like to implement doesn't already work out of the box, you can
add try to change the examples for the intentless policy. Don't forget that you
can also add and edit the traditional Rasa primitives like intents, entities,
slots, rules, etc. as you normally would. The `IntentlessPolicy` will kick in
only when the traditional primitives have low confidence.

### End-to-End stories

As part of the beta, we're also releasing a beta version of a new End-To-End
testing framework. The `rasa test e2e` command allows you to test your bot
end-to-end, i.e. from the user's perspective. You can use it to test your bot in
a variety of ways, including testing the `IntentlessPolicy`.

To use the new testing framework, you need to define a set of test cases in a
test folder, e.g. `tests/e2e_test_stories.yml`. The test cases are defined in a
similar format as stories are, but contain the user's messages and the bot's
responses. Here's an example:

```yaml title="tests/e2e_test_stories.yml"
test_cases:
  - test_case: transfer charge
    steps:
      - user: how can I send money without getting charged?
      - utter: utter_faq_0
      - user: not zelle. a normal transfer
      - utter: utter_faq_7
```

**Please ensure all your test stories have unique names!** After setting the
beta feature flag for E2E testing in your current shell with
`export RASA_PRO_BETA_E2E=true`, you can run the tests with
`rasa test e2e -f tests/e2e_test_stories.yml`

## Security Considerations

The intentless policy uses the OpenAI API to create responses. 
This means that your users conversations are sent to OpenAI's servers.

The response generated by OpenAI is not send back to the bot's user. However, 
the user can craft messages that will misslead the intentless policy. These
cases are handled gracefully and fallbacks are triggered.

The prompt used for classification won't be exposed to the user using prompt
injection. This is because the generated response from the LLM is mapped to
one of the existing responses from the domain, 
preventing any leakage of the prompt to the user.

More detailed information can be found in Rasa's webinar on
[LLM Security in the Enterprise](https://info.rasa.com/webinars/llm-security-in-the-enterprise-replay).

## FAQ

### What about entities?

Entities are currently not handled by the intentless policy. They have to still
be dealt with using the traditional NLU approaches and slots.

### What about custom actions?

At this point, the intentless policy can only predict utterances but not custom
actions. Triggering custom actions needs to be done by traditional policies,
such as the rule- or memoization policy.
