As part of a beta release, we have released multiple components 
which make use of the latest generation of Large Language Models (LLMs).
This document offers an overview of what you can do with them.
We encourage you to experiment with these components and share your findings with us.
We are working on some larger changes to the platform that leverage LLMs natively.
Please reach out to us if you'd like to learn more about upcoming changes.


## LLMs can do more than just NLU

The recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened up new
possibilities for conversational AI. LLMs are pretrained models that can be
used to perform a variety of tasks, including intent classification,
dialogue handling, and natural language generation (NLG). The components described
here all use in-context learning. In other words, instructions and examples are
provided in a prompt which are sent to a general-purpose LLM. They do not require
fine-tuning of large models.

### Plug & Play LLMs of your choice

Just like our NLU pipeline, the LLM components here can be configured to use different
LLMs. There is no one-size-fits-all best model, and new models are being released every
week. We encourage you to try out different models and evaluate their performance on 
different languages in terms of fluency, accuracy, and latency.

### An adjustable risk profile

The potential and risks of LLMs vary per use case. For customer-facing use cases, 
you may not ever want to send generated text to your users. Rasa gives you full 
control over where and when you want to make use of LLMs. You can use LLMs for NLU and
dialogue, and still only send messages that were authored by a human. 
You can also allow an LLM to rephrase your existing messages to account for context.

It's essential that your system provides full
control over these processes. Understanding how LLMs and other components
behave and have the power to override any decision.

## Where to go from here

This section of the documentation guides you through the diverse ways you can
integrate LLMs into Rasa. We will delve into the following topics:

1. [Setting up LLMs](./llm-setup.mdx)
2. [Intentless Policy](./llm-intentless.mdx)
4. [LLM Intent Classification](./llm-intent.mdx)
5. [Response Rephrasing](./llm-nlg.mdx)

Each link will direct you to a detailed guide on the respective topic, offering
further depth and information about using LLMs with Rasa. By the end of this
series, you'll be equipped to effectively use LLMs to augment your Rasa
applications.
