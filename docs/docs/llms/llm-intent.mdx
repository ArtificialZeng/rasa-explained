## Key Features

1. **Few shot learning**: The intent classifier can be trained with only a few
   examples per intent. New intents can be bootstrapped and integrated even if
   there are only a handful of training examples available.
2. **Fast Training**: The intent classifier is very quick to train.
3. **Multilingual**: The intent classifier can be trained on multilingual data
   and can classify messages in many languages, though performance will vary across LLMs.

## Overview

The LLM-based intent classifier is a new intent classifier that uses large
language models (LLMs) to classify intents. The LLM-based intent classifier
relies on a method called retrieval augmented generation (RAG), which combines
the benefits of retrieval-based and generation-based approaches.

During trainin the classifier

1. embeds all intent examples and 
2. stores their embeddings in a vector store.

During prediction the classifier

1. embeds the current message and
2. uses the embedding to find similar intent examples in the vector store.
3. The retrieved examples are ranked based on similarity to the current message and
4. the most similar ones are included in an LLM prompt. The prompt guides the LLM to
   predict the intent of the message.
5. LLM predicts an intent label. 
6. The generated label is mapped to an intent of the domain. The LLM can also
   predict a label that is not part of the training data. In this case, the
   intent from the domain with the most similar embedding is predicted.

## Using the LLM-based Intent Classifier in Your Bot

To use the LLM-based intent classifier in your bot, you need to add the
`LLMIntentClassifier` to your NLU pipeline in the `config.yml` file.

```yaml-rasa title="config.yml"
pipeline:
# - ...
  - name: rasa_plus.ml.LLMIntentClassifier
# - ...
```

The LLM-based intent classifier requires access to an LLM model API. You can use any
OpenAI model that supports the `/completions` endpoint. 
We are working on expanding the list of supported
models and model providers.

## Customizing

You can customize the LLM by modifying the following parameters in the
`config.yml` file. **All of the parameters are optional.**

### Fallback Intent

The fallback intent is used when the LLM predicts an intent that wasn't part of
the training data. You can set the fallback intent by adding the following
parameter to the `config.yml` file.

```yaml-rasa title="config.yml"
pipeline:
# - ...
  - name: rasa_plus.ml.LLMIntentClassifier
    fallback_intent: "out_of_scope"
# - ...
```

Defaults to `out_of_scope`.

### LLM / Embeddings

You can choose the OpenAI model that is used for the LLM by adding the `llm.model_name`
parameter to the `config.yml` file.

```yaml-rasa title="config.yml"
pipeline:
# - ...
  - name: rasa_plus.ml.LLMIntentClassifier
    llm:
      model_name: "text-davinci-003"
# - ...
```

Defaults to `text-davinci-003`. The model name needs to be set to a generative
model using the completions API of
[OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/completions-api).

If you want to use Azure OpenAI Service, you can configure the necessary 
parameters as described in the 
[Azure OpenAI Service](./llm-setup.mdx#additional-configuration-for-azure-openai-service) 
section.

:::info Using Other LLMs / Embeddings

By default, OpenAI is used as the underlying LLM and embedding provider. 

The used LLM provider and embeddings provider can be configured in the
`config.yml` file to use another provider, e.g. `cohere`: 

```yaml-rasa title="config.yml"
pipeline:
# - ...
  - name: rasa_plus.ml.LLMIntentClassifier
    llm:
      type: "cohere"
    embeddings:
      type: "cohere"
# - ...
```

For more information, see the
[LLM setup page on llms and embeddings](./llm-setup.mdx#other-llms--embeddings)

:::

### Temperature

The temperature parameter controls the randomness of the LLM predictions. You
can set the temperature by adding the `llm.temperature` parameter to the `config.yml`
file.

```yaml-rasa title="config.yml"
pipeline:
# - ...
  - name: rasa_plus.ml.LLMIntentClassifier
    llm:
      temperature: 0.7
# - ...
```

Defaults to `0.7`. The temperature needs to be a float between 0 and 2. The
higher the temperature, the more random the predictions will be. The lower the
temperature, the more likely the LLM will predict the same intent for the same
message.

### Prompt

The prompt is the text that is used to guide the LLM to predict the intent of
the message. You can customize the prompt by adding the following parameter to
the `config.yml` file.

```yaml-rasa title="config.yml"
pipeline:
# - ...
  - name: rasa_plus.ml.LLMIntentClassifier
    prompt: |
      Label a users message from a
      conversation with an intent. Reply ONLY with the name of the intent.

      The intent should be one of the following:
      {% for intent in intents %}- {{intent}}
      {% endfor %}
      {% for example in examples %}
      Message: {{example['text']}}
      Intent: {{example['intent']}}
      {% endfor %}
      Message: {{message}}
      Intent:
```

The prompt is a [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) template
that can be used to customize the prompt. The following variables are available
in the prompt:

- `examples`: A list of the closest examples from the training data. Each
  example is a dictionary with the keys `text` and `intent`.
- `message`: The message that needs to be classified.
- `intents`: A list of all intents in the training data.

The default prompt template results in the following prompt:

```
Label a users message from a
conversation with an intent. Reply ONLY with 
the name of the intent.

The intent should be one of the following:
- affirm
- greet

Message: Hello
Intent: greet

Message: Yes, I am
Intent: affirm

Message: hey there
Intent:
```

### Number of Intent Examples

The number of examples that are used to guide the LLM to predict the intent of
the message can be customized by adding the `number_of_examples` parameter to the
`config.yml` file:

```yaml-rasa title="config.yml"
pipeline:
# - ...
  - name: rasa_plus.ml.LLMIntentClassifier
    number_of_examples: 3
# - ...
```

Defaults to `10`. The examples are selected based on their similarity to the
current message. By default, the examples are included in the prompt like this:
```
Message: Hello
Intent: greet

Message: Yes, I am
Intent: affirm
```

## Security Considerations

The intent classifier uses the OpenAI API to classify intents. 
This means that your users conversations are sent to OpenAI's servers for 
classification.

The response generated by OpenAI is not send back to the bot's user. However, 
the user can craft messages that will lead the classification to 
fail for their message.

The prompt used for classification won't be exposed to the user using prompt
injection. This is because the generated response from the LLM is mapped to
one of the existing intents, preventing any leakage of the prompt to the user.

## Evaluating Performance

1. Run an evaluation by splitting the NLU data into training and testing sets
   and comparing the performance of the current pipeline with the LLM-based
   pipeline.
2. Run cross-validation on all of the data to get a more robust estimate of the
   performance of the LLM-based pipeline.
3. Use the `rasa test nlu` command with multiple configurations (e.g., one with
   the current pipeline and one with the LLM-based pipeline) to compare their
   performance.
4. Compare the latency of the LLM-based pipeline with that of the current
   pipeline to see if there are any significant differences in speed.
