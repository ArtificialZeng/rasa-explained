description: Messages that are being processed lock Rasa for a given conversation ID to ensure that multiple incoming messages for that conversation do not interfere with each other. Rasa provides multiple implementations to maintain conversation locks.

import RasaProLabel from '@theme/RasaProLabel';

Rasa uses a ticket lock mechanism to ensure that incoming messages for a given
conversation ID are processed in the right order, and locks conversations while
messages are actively processed. This means multiple Rasa servers can
be run in parallel as replicated services, and clients do not necessarily need to
address the same node when sending messages for a given conversation ID.

## InMemoryLockStore (default)

- **Description**

  `InMemoryLockStore` is the default lock store. It maintains conversation locks
  within a single process.

  :::note
  This lock store should not be used when multiple Rasa servers are run
  parallel.

  :::

- **Configuration**

  To use the `InMemoryTrackerStore` no configuration is needed.

## ConcurrentRedisLockStore

<RasaProLabel/>

<RasaProBanner/>

`ConcurrentRedisLockStore` is a new lock store that uses Redis as a persistence layer and is safe for use with multiple Rasa server replicas.
See the [migration section](#migration-guide) to learn how to switch to this lock store.

### Description

The `ConcurrentRedisLockStore` uses Redis as a persistence layer for instances of issued [tickets](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/reference/rasa/core/lock/#ticket-objects) and the last issued ticket number.

The ticket number initialization begins at 1, in contrast to that of the`RedisLockStore` which begins at 0.
If the ticket expires, the ticket number will not be reassigned to future tickets; as a result ticket numbers are unique to ticket instances.
Ticket numbers are incremented using the Redis atomic transaction INCR on the persisted last issued ticket number.

The `ConcurrentRedisLockStore` ensures that only one Rasa instance can handle a conversation at any point in time.
Therefore, this Redis implementation of the `LockStore` can handle messages received in parallel for the same conversation by different Rasa servers
This is the recommended lock store for running a replicated set of Rasa servers.

### Configuration

To set up Rasa with Redis the following steps are required:

1. Start your Redis instance

2. Add required configuration to your `endpoints.yml`

```yaml-rasa
lock_store:
    type: rasa_plus.components.concurrent_lock_store.ConcurrentRedisLockStore
    host: <host of the redis instance, e.g. localhost>
    port: <port of your redis instance, usually 6379>
    password: <password used for authentication>
    db: <number of your database within redis, e.g. 0>
    key_prefix: <alphanumeric value to prepend to lock store keys>
```

3. To start the Rasa Core server using your Redis backend, add the `--endpoints`
   flag, e.g.:

    ```bash
    rasa run -m models --endpoints endpoints.yml
    ```

### Parameters

- `url` (default: `localhost`): The url of your redis instance
- `port` (default: `6379`): The port which redis is running on
- `db` (default: `1`): The number of your redis database
- `key_prefix` (default: `None`): The prefix to prepend to lock store keys. Must
  be alphanumeric
- `password` (default: `None`): Password used for authentication
  (`None` equals no authentication)
- `use_ssl` (default: `False`): Whether or not the communication is encrypted -`socket_timeout` (default: `10`): Time in seconds after which an
  error is raised if Redis doesn't answer

### Migration Guide

To switch from the `RedisLockStore` to the `ConcurrentRedisLockStore`, specify the complete module path to the `ConcurrentRedisLockStore` class as `type` in `endpoints.yml`:

```yaml-rasa
lock_store:
    type: rasa_plus.components.concurrent_lock_store.ConcurrentRedisLockStore
    host: <host of the redis instance, e.g. localhost>
    port: <port of your redis instance, usually 6379>
    password: <password used for authentication>
    db: <number of your database within redis, e.g. 0>
    key_prefix: <alphanumeric value to prepend to lock store keys>
```

You must replace the `url` field in the redis lock store configuration with a field `host` containing the hostname of the redis instance.

No database migration is required when switching to the `ConcurrentRedisLockStore`. You can use the same Redis instance and database number as you did previously when using the `RedisLockStore`.
You may want to delete all the preexisting keys if using the same Redis database number.
These former key-value items are no longer required by the `ConcurrentRedisLockStore` and the database can be cleared.

There is no overlap in key-value items stored when using the `RedisLockStore` and the `ConcurrentRedisLockStore`, because the `RedisLockStore` persists serialized [TicketLock](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/reference/rasa/core/lock/#ticketlock-objects) instances while the `ConcurrentRedisLockStore` instead stores individual [`Ticket`](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/reference/rasa/core/lock/#ticket-objects) instances, as well as the last issued ticket number.
The `ConcurrentRedisLockStore` recreates the `TicketLock` from the persisted `Ticket` instances, which allows it to handle concurrent messages for the same conversation ID.

## RedisLockStore

- **Description**

  `RedisLockStore` maintains conversation locks using Redis as a persistence layer.
  This is the recommended lock store for running a replicated set of Rasa servers.

- **Configuration**

  To set up Rasa with Redis the following steps are required:

  1. Start your Redis instance

  2. Add required configuration to your `endpoints.yml`

      ```yaml-rasa
      lock_store:
          type: "redis"
          url: <url of the redis instance, e.g. localhost>
          port: <port of your redis instance, usually 6379>
          password: <password used for authentication>
          db: <number of your database within redis, e.g. 0>
          key_prefix: <alphanumeric value to prepend to lock store keys>
      ```

  3. To start the Rasa Core server using your Redis backend, add the `--endpoints`
     flag, e.g.:

    ```bash
    rasa run -m models --endpoints endpoints.yml
    ```

- **Parameters**

  - `url` (default: `localhost`): The url of your redis instance

  - `port` (default: `6379`): The port which redis is running on

  - `db` (default: `1`): The number of your redis database

  - `key_prefix` (default: `None`): The prefix to prepend to lock store keys. Must
    be alphanumeric

  - `password` (default: `None`): Password used for authentication
    (`None` equals no authentication)

  - `use_ssl` (default: `False`): Whether or not the communication is encrypted

  - `ssl_keyfile` (default: `None`): Path to an ssl private key

  - `ssl_certfile` (default: `None`): Path to an ssl certificate

  - `ssl_ca_certs` (default: `None`): The path to a file of concatenated CA certificates in PEM format

  - `socket_timeout` (default: `10`): Time in seconds after which an
    error is raised if Redis doesn't answer

## Custom Lock Store

If you need a lock store which is not available out of the box, you can implement your own.
This is done by extending the base class `LockStore`.

Your custom lock store class must also implement the following methods:

- `get_lock`: fetches lock for `conversation_id` from storage; requires `conversation_id` text parameter and returns `TicketLock` instance.
  [(source code - see for signature)](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa/blob/main/rasa/core/lock_store.py#L59).
- `save_lock`: commit `lock` object to storage; requires `lock` parameter which is of type `TicketLock`and returns `None`.
  [(source code - see for signature)](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa/blob/main/rasa/core/lock_store.py#L67).
- `delete_lock`: deletes lock for `conversation_id` from storage; requires `conversation_id` text parameter and returns `None`.
  [(source code - see for signature)](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa/blob/main/rasa/core/lock_store.py#L63).

### Configuration

Put the module path to your custom event broker and the parameters you require in your `endpoints.yml`:

```yaml-rasa title="endpoints.yml"
lock_store:
  type: path.to.your.module.Class
  url: localhost
  a_parameter: a value
  another_parameter: another value
```
