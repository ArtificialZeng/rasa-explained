:::info New in 3.6

You can now anonymize personally identifiable information (PII) data in your logs and events streamed via Kafka event
broker only. Continue reading to learn how to enable the anonymization of PII data.

:::

Management of sensitive customer data collected by assistants is a critical requirement for complying with regulations
and managing the data securely while making it available for analysis.
Rasa Pro 3.6 introduces the ability to anonymize PII data in your logs and events streamed via the Kafka event broker.

Note that the Tracker Store continues to store conversation data which is not anonymized. This is required so that we
retain a source of truth of pristine data for non-repudiation purposes. Learn how to secure your Tracker Store
using [Vault secrets manager](./secrets-managers.mdx) to protect the source of truth with rotating credentials.

In addition, because the tracker store data plays a vital role in the assistant's dialogue management at inference time,
anonymizing data in flight could have undesirable consequences for the assistant's dialogue management action predictions.

## Architecture Overview

The anonymization of the Rasa event is run through an anonymization pipeline at the end of the dialogue management
action prediction and execution. Note that the processing done by the anonymization pipeline is scheduled as a background
task and does not affect the assistant's response time.

The anonymization steps are as follows:
1. The Rasa agent invokes the anonymization pipeline during each user message handling.
2. The anonymization pipeline runs through a sequence of anonymization rules that are applied to the new events.
3. The pipeline publishes the anonymized events to the Kafka topic that is mapped to the anonymization rule list in
`endpoints.yml`.
4. The tracker store saves the original events that are not anonymized.

### Supported Rasa Events

The Rasa events that are anonymized include the following:
- `user`
- `bot`
- `slot`
- `entities`

### Supported PII entity types

The anonymization pipeline uses [Microsoft Presidio](https://microsoft.github.io/presidio/text_anonymization/) as both entity recognizer and
anonymizer. Presidio is an open-source library that supports a wide range of entity types and anonymization methods.

You can specify any of the out-of-the-box [supported Presidio entity types](https://microsoft.github.io/presidio/supported_entities/) in the anonymization rules.
Note that it is currently not possible to add custom entity types for the Rasa Pro anonymization pipeline.

## How to write anonymization rules

You can now write anonymization rules in `endpoints.yml` to explicitly declare which Presidio entities should be anonymized.
The anonymization pipeline is configurable via the `anonymization` section in the `endpoints.yml` file.
This section must have the structure given in the following example:

```yaml
anonymization:
  metadata:
    language: en
    model_name: en_core_web_lg
    model_provider: spacy
  rule_lists:
    - id: rules_1
      rules:
        - entity: PERSON
          substitution: text
          value: John Doe
        - entity: LOCATION
          substitution: faker
        - entity: CREDIT_CARD
          substitution: faker
        - entity: IBAN_CODE
          substitution: faker
    - id: rules_2
      rules:
        - entity: CREDIT_CARD
          substitution: mask
        - entity: IBAN_CODE
          substitution: mask
```

### How to populate the metadata section

The metadata section contains the following fields: `language`, `model_name`, and `model_provider`.

The `language` field specifies the language code of the text to be anonymized. Note that you can only specify one language
per anonymization pipeline, therefore the capability is currently not able to handle language switching by end users.

The `model_name` and `model_provider` fields specify the name and provider of the Presidio model to be used for
anonymization. The available model providers are `spacy`, `stanza` and `transformers`.

If you want to use `spacy`, we strongly recommend to use the available large models, such as `en_core_web_lg` or `es_core_news_lg`.
This is to ensure more accurate entity recognition.

:::caution
When using large models, you must ensure that your Rasa Pro environment has enough memory to load the model.

:::

If you opt for using the `transformers` model provider, you must specify two model names in the `model_name` field:
the HuggingFace model name and the spaCy model name, where the spaCy model would wrap the transformers NER model.
For example:

```yaml
anonymization:
  metadata:
    language: en
    model_name:
       spacy: en_core_web_lg
       transformers: dslim/bert-base-NER
    model_provider: transformers
```
#### How to install the language  model

You must install the model you declare to the `model_name` field in your Rasa Pro environment.
For example, if you declare `model_name: en_core_web_lg`, you must install the spaCy `en_core_web_lg` model in your Rasa Pro environment.
You can follow model installation instructions for spaCy and stanza models in the [Presidio official documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/presidio/analyzer/nlp_engines/spacy_stanza/).

In the case of the `transformers` model provider, you must install _both_  models that you declare in the `model_name` field
in your Rasa Pro environment. For example, if you declare `transformers: dslim/bert-base-NER` in `endpoints.yml`, you must
install the `dslim/bert-base-NER` model in your Rasa Pro environment. You can find model download instructions for
`HuggingFace` in the [Presidio official documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/presidio/analyzer/nlp_engines/transformers/).

:::note
Not all languages have a pre-trained language model available. If you want to use a language that does not have
a pre-trained language model available, you must train your own [spaCy](https://spacy.io/usage/training), [stanza](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/training.html)
or [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/training) model and install it in your Rasa Pro environment.

### How to populate the rule_lists section

The `rule_lists` section contains a list of anonymization rule lists. Each rule list must have a unique `id` of type
string and a list of `rules`. Each rule must have an `entity` field and a `substitution` field. The `entity` field
specifies the Presidio entity type to be anonymized and must be in uppercase. Note that regular expressions are currently
not supported for identifying entities.

The `substitution` field specifies the anonymization method to be used. Currently, the
following anonymization methods are supported: `text`, `mask`, and `faker`:
- The `text` anonymization method replaces the original entity value with the value specified in the `value` field.
In the following example, the `PERSON` entity value will be replaced with `John Doe`.
```yaml
anonymization:
  metadata:
    language: en
    model_name: en_core_web_lg
    model_provider: spacy
  rule_lists:
    - id: rules_1
      rules:
        - entity: PERSON
          substitution: text
          value: John Doe
```
- The `mask` anonymization method replaces the original entity value with a mask of the same length using the character '*'.
For example, if the original entity value is `John Doe`, the anonymized value will be `********`.
```yaml
anonymization:
  metadata:
    language: en
    model_name: en_core_web_lg
    model_provider: spacy
  rule_lists:
    - id: rules_1
      rules:
        - entity: PERSON
          substitution: mask
```

- The `faker` anonymization method replaces the original entity value with a fake value generated by the [Faker](https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library.
For example, if the original entity value is `John Doe`, the anonymized value will be replaced with a fake name generated by the Faker library.
```yaml
anonymization:
  metadata:
    language: en
    model_name: en_core_web_lg
    model_provider: spacy
  rule_lists:
    - id: rules_1
      rules:
        - entity: PERSON
          substitution: faker
```

If no substitution method is specified, the default substitution method is `mask`.

The `value` field is only required for the `text` anonymization method. It specifies the text to be used as the anonymized value.
If the `value` field is not specified, the original entity value to be anonymized will be replaced with the entity type
name between brackets. For example, if the `value` field is not specified for the `PERSON` entity type, the anonymized
value will be `<PERSON>`.

The `faker` anonymization method uses the [Faker](https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library to generate fake data.
By default, the `faker` anonymization method will generate fake data in English unless a localized Presidio
entity type is used. For example, if you use the `faker` substitution method for the `ES_NIF` entity type, the generated
fake data will match the format of a Spanish NIF.

The `faker` substitution method does not support the following Presidio entity types:
- `CRYPTO`, `NRP`, `MEDICAL_LICENSE`
- `US_BANK_NUMBER`, `US_DRIVER_LICENSE`
- `UK_NHS`
- `IT_FISCAL_CODE`, `IT_DRIVER_LICENSE`, `IT_PASSPORT`, `IT_IDENTITY_CARD`
- `SG_NRIC_FIN`
- `AU_ABN`, `AU_ACN`, `AU_TFN`, `AU_MEDICARE`

If any of the above entities is used together with the `faker` substitution method, the anonymization pipeline will default
to the `mask` substitution method.

## How to update the Kafka event broker configuration

The anonymization pipeline uses Kafka to publish the anonymized events to the Kafka topic that is mapped to the
anonymization rule list. You can configure the Kafka event broker in the `endpoints.yml` file. The Kafka event broker
must contain the `anonymization_topics` section, which must have the following structure:

```yaml
event_broker:
  type: kafka
  partition_by_sender: True
  security_protocol: PLAINTEXT
  url: localhost
  anonymization_topics:
    - name: topic_1
      anonymization_rules: rules_1
    - name: topic_2
      anonymization_rules: rules_2
  client_id: kafka-python-rasa
```

The `anonymization_topics` section contains a list of Kafka topics to which the anonymized events will be published.
Each Kafka topic must have a `name` field and an `anonymization_rules` field. The `name` field specifies the name of the
Kafka topic. The `anonymization_rules` field specifies the `id` of the anonymization rule list to be used for the Kafka topic.

## How to enable anonymization of PII in logs

You can enable anonymization of PII in logs by filling the `logger` section in the `endpoints.yml` file.
The `logger` section must have the following structure:

```yaml
logger:
  formatter:
    anonymization_rules: rules_1
```

The `anonymization_rules` field specifies the `id` of the anonymization rule list to be used for the logs.

:::caution
We strongly recommend to run with log level INFO in production.
Running with log level DEBUG will increase the assistant's response latency because of processing delays.
