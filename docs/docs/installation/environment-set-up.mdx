## 1. Python Environment Setup

Check if your Python environment is already configured:

```bash
python3 --version
pip3 --version
```

:::note Python3 Supported Versions

Currently, rasa supports the following Python versions: `3.7`, `3.8`, `3.9` and `3.10`.
Note that Python `3.10` is only supported for versions `3.4.x` and upwards.
Additionally, rasa installation on Apple Silicon with Python `3.10` is not functional in `3.4.x` but will be supported starting from `3.5.x`.

If these packages are already installed, these commands should display version
numbers for each step, and you can skip to the next step.

Otherwise, proceed with the instructions below to install them.

<Tabs values={[{"label": "Ubuntu", "value": "ubuntu"}, {"label": "macOS", "value": "macos"}, {"label": "Windows", "value": "windows"}]}  groupId="operating-systems" defaultValue="ubuntu">
  <TabItem value="ubuntu">

Fetch the relevant packages using `apt`, and install virtualenv using `pip`.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-dev python3-pip
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="macos">

Install the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) package manager if you haven't already.

Once you're done, you can install Python3.

```bash
brew update
brew install python
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="windows">

Make sure the Microsoft VC++ Compiler is installed, so python can compile
any dependencies. You can get the compiler from <a className="reference external"
  href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/"
  target="_blank">Visual Studio</a>. Download the installer and select
VC++ Build tools in the list.Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) (64-bit version) for Windows.

```bat
C:\> pip3 install -U pip
```

## 2. Virtual Environment Setup

This step is optional, but we strongly recommend isolating python projects
using virtual environments. Tools like
[virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) and
[virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) provide
isolated Python environments, which are cleaner than installing packages system-wide
(as they prevent dependency conflicts). They also let you install packages
without root privileges.

Create a new virtual environment by choosing a Python interpreter and making a `./venv` directory to hold it:

```bash
python3 -m venv ./venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

## M1 / M2 (Apple Silicon) Limitations

Rasa installations on Apple Silicon _don't_ use [Apple Metal](https://developer.apple.com/metal/) by default.
We found that using the GPU on Apple Silicon increased training time for the
[`DIETClassifier`](../components.mdx#dietclassifier) and [`TEDPolicy`](../policies.mdx#ted-policy) dramatically.
You can, however, install the optional dependency to test it yourself
or try it with other components using: `pip3 install rasa[metal]`.

Currently, not all of Rasa's dependencies support Apple Silicon natively. This leads
to the following restrictions:

- You can not run Duckling as a docker container on Apple Silicon. If you want
  to use the [duckling entity extractor](../components.mdx#ducklingentityextractor) we recommend a cloud deployment of
  duckling. Progress on this can be tracked on the
  [Duckling project](https://github.com/facebook/duckling/issues/695).
- Rasa on Apple Silicon does not support the [`ConveRTFeaturizer` component](../components.mdx#convertfeaturizer) or pipelines
  containing it. The component relies on `tensorflow-text` which currently
  isn't available for Apple Silicon. Progress on this can be tracked on the
  [Tensorflow Text project](https://github.com/tensorflow/text/issues/823).
