Added metadata as an additional argument as an additional parameter to an
`Action`s `run` method.

Added an additional default action called `action_send_text` which allows
a policy to respond with a text. The text is passed to the action using the
metadata, e.g. `metadata={"message": {"text": "Hello"}}`.

Added LLM utility functions.
